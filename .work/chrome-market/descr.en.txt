Click extension button to play awesome 8-bit chiptune music. Click again to stop.
It's all.

This extension just streams music from keygenmusic.tk (collection of 8-bit chiptune).
Music is absolutely free and legal. Visit keygenmusic.tk for details.

Tip:
- Double-click on extension button to play next track
- Hold cursor on extension button when music stopped. You'll see Total Played statistic.
This feature implemented in v1.1 so there is no info about played time before this update.
