The idea of extension is simplicity. One button UI.  
Click on the icon to start. Click again to stop.  
Each time you click the icon extension is shuffling playlist.  
It is like radio. You never know next track.  
At the moment, there are more than 6 days of non-stop playing :scream:

**Tips:**  
- Double click on extension icon for next track.
- Hower on extension icon to see Total played statistics (when stopped)
